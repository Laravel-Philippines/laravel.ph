<h2> Notes</h2>

<p>This is what gets deployed to production (www.laravel.ph)</p>

<p>I personally made some changes because I feel we don't need a REAL spa app with authenticated routes and all</p>



<p align="center" style="background: orange">Btw: layouts/spaapp.blade.php is a pun. Its really non spa 	:grinning:</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

Run thesetup.sh to get composer, and then run npm install

You'll also need to install vue@2.9.x (vue-cli legacy). I'll add more details in the docs/ folder -joe
