<h2> Notes</h2>

<p>This is what gets deployed to production (www.laravel.ph)</p>

<p>I personally made some changes because I feel we don't need a REAL spa app with authenticated routes and all</p>

<p>We are using git submodules to get the frontend code

<h3>Installation</h3>

Run the script `setup.sh` to automatically get composer, and then run npm install

```
./setup.sh
```

You'll also need to install vue@2.9.x (vue-cli legacy). I'll add more details in the docs/ folder -joe
